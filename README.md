Need For Speed 2015 Money Glitch Automation with Pyautogui / Pydirectinput
## What does this do ?
Basically it launch the game, sell all the parts, close the game and repeat the same process over again. This process takes around 3 minutes and give you 39K credits, so in 1 hour of letting it run automatically you earn 390K credits (passive income, yay)
